He himself came from the world of Libair, and like all Libairians, he was highly pigmented and his skin was a deep, rich brown. There were few worlds in the Galaxy in which the skin color was so extreme as on either Libair or Florina. Generally, intermediate shades were the rule.

They insisted that on the original planet, whatever it was, mankind had already been split into subgroups of varying pigmentation.

one of those worlds whose history could be counted in millennia and whose language was so archaic that its dialect might almost be that lost and mythical language, English. They had a special word for a man with dark skin.

Somehow men and women met on Florina and plotted rebellion. Usually these were surreptitiously supported by Trantorian money.

Now Trantor trembled at the brink of a new conversion: from Trantorian Empire to Galactic Empire and then the red would engulf all the stars and there would be universal peace&mdash;pax Trantorica.

&ldquo;I am, but there lies the kinship. We are both extremes in a Galaxy of the average.&rdquo; &ldquo;Extremes? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; Junz said, &ldquo;In skin pigmentation. They are unusually pale. We are unusually dark. It means something. It binds us together. It gives us something in common. It seems to me our ancestors must have had long histories of being different, even of being excluded from the social majority. We are unfortunate whites and darks, brothers in being different.&rdquo;

In some regions there is a little more helium than normal; in other places, more sodium than normal; and so on. These regions of special analytic makeup wind through space like currents. That&rsquo;s what they call them. They&rsquo;re the currents of space. It&rsquo;s important to know how these currents are arranged because that might explain how the universe was created and how it developed.&rdquo;

It had more uses, more versatility than any substance known to man. If it were not so expensive it could be used to replace glass, metal, or plastic in any of infinite industrial applications.

He adjusted his blaster to maximum dispersion and turned it on the unconscious Squire. In ten seconds only a charred mass was left. It would delay identification, confuse the pursuers.

&ldquo;I remember Earth. It was radioactive. I remember the Forbidden Areas and the blue horizon at night. The soil glowed and nothing would grow in it. There were just a few spots men could live on. That&rsquo;s why I was a Spatio-analyst. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t mind staying in space. My world was a dead world.&rdquo;

With trimensic personification perfected, important conferences were rarely held face to face.

&ldquo;On the other hand, help Florina and you will have shown that Trantor puts its responsibility to the people of the Galaxy above the maintenance of mere property rights. Trantor will win good will that it could never win by force.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Is it? There must be a reason why kyrt is kyrt on Florina and cotton elsewhere. Scientists have tried many ways of artificially producing kyrt elsewhere, but they tried blindly, so they&rsquo;ve always failed. Now they will know it is due to factors induced in a pre-nova stellar system.&rdquo;
